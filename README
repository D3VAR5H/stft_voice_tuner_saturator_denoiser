This program is meant to be the free replacement of iZotope products.
It tries to detect root key. Run again if you're not satisfied.
To use it, put voice and noise profile. It may just work.
This program is tuned for my mic. Change some numbers for your mic if it doesn't work for you.
Also: THIS PROGRAM IS NO LONGER COMPATIBLE WITH "Virtual ANS". To make it compatible change notemax to 119.
